            I&apos;m Leah and yes&sbquo; I&apos;m the Queen of Snow
            Globes&sbquo; at least! Queen of Snow Globes is the culmination of
            years of dreaming&sbquo; planning and working to build something
            meaningful.
          </p>

          <p>Deep in my soul&sbquo; I&apos;m a dreamer.</p>

          <p>
            I dreamed of being my own boss&sbquo; of having my own place in the
            business world. I dreamed of collaborating daily with
            like&ndash;minded people in a shared goal. But I never dreamed
            I&apos;d be working with amazing people from all around the
            world&sbquo; creating countless tiny &ldquo;worlds of pure
            imagination&rdquo;.
          </p>

          <p>
            And that&apos;s what snow globes really are. More than the sum of
            their parts &ndash; glass&sbquo; resin and water &ndash; snow globes
            are the most magically portable miniature worlds.
